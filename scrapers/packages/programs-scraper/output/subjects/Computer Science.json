Some course numbers are unique to a specific campus, and others are shared between campuses. When a course with a common number is offered at U of T Mississauga, students are expected to take the course at the U of T Mississauga, even if that course is offered on a different campus in a different academic term. Due to enrolment pressures, U of T Mississauga students may not always be able to enrol in courses unique to the other campuses. We welcome inquiries from U of T students at the other two campuses about taking Computer Science courses unique to the U of T Mississauga campus.
